# Only Lonely for measuring how lonely you feel.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

After Covid-19, many people don't go out much and live alone. As a result, more and more people are feeling lonely. This app is an app that allows you to check how lonely you feel.

### Feature

You can measure your loneliness using ucla loneliness scale version 3.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
